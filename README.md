# Lab 7 Together

This repository contains the materials for Task 2 of lab 7.
You will need to update the Jupyter Notebook as well as the CSV file.

The instructions for the rest of the lab is copied below.

## Instructions for Students

This lab is given in two parts: In Task 1 you will need to work in your own repository. Then, in Task 2, you will work in a group repository. You need to complete both parts to pass this lab. 

If you have not already, you will need to set up Git on your computer. You can do the following:

- Install Git on your computer. You can follow [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Login to Github in VS code to link your accounts. You can do this in the 'accounts' tab in the VS Code UI. 

You may need to restart your computer for changes to take effect.

## Part 1

- Following [these](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-clone-repository?view=vs-2022) instructions, `clone` your lab repository and select a place in your computer to store it. 
- Answer the questions in lab7_1.ipynb
- Push your changes to your assignment repository.

## Part 2
- Meet up in your groups
- Follow the instructions in lab7_2.ipynb

## Part 3

- Go to [this](https://github.com/TIL6022-Python-Programming/lab7-together) repository and clone the repository as before.
- Before you continue, you will need to create your own branch. NAME THIS BRANCH THE SAME AS YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT USERNAME. You can find instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-create-branch?view=vs-2022)
- Work through the Jupyter Notebook.
- `commit` your changes and `push` them back to your branch. 
- Create a pull request to merge into main. You can find instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
 
When you are working in groups, you will often need to check each others code. You can do this by committing your changes to your branch and then make a pull request to merge into the main branch. Then, one of your groupmates can have a look at your code before approving it!

### Passing Criteria
- At least three out of the four first questions correct.
- Provided link to the group repository in question 5 in Part 1.
- Successfully push changes to Task 1 into your assignment repository.
- Successfully clone and create a branch of the group repository, make changes and merge them to the original branch. You will only be graded on your own merge request.
- Successfully clone and create a branch of the repository in task 2, and make changes, push and create a merge request.


> [!WARNING]
> Do not change the test file and the file name of the Jupyter Notebook.
